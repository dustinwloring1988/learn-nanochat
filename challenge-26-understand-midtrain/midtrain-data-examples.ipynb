This result suggests a relatively moderate amount of daily study time, with most students likely dedicating a few hours to studying each day.

      "The standard deviation is calculated as the square root of the variance. The variance is calculated as the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.\n",

      "2. Square these deviations: (0.05)^2, (-1.95)^2, (-0.95)^2, ..., (1.05)^2\n",

      "In this case, the standard deviation provides a more accurate representation of dispersion than the range (the difference between the maximum and minimum values), as the range can be heavily influenced by extreme values (outliers). The standard deviation, on the other hand, takes into account all the data points and is less affected by outliers.\n",

      "To calculate the median, first, arrange the data in ascending order: 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6. Since there are 20 values (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values: (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "To calculate the mode, identify the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. The value \"2\" appears 6 times, making it the mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the median (2.5) and mode (2), both are lower than the mean (2.95). This suggests that the mean may be slightly inflated by the higher values in the dataset. The median and mode might provide a more accurate representation of the \"typical\" study time for students in this sample, as they are less affected by extreme values.\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, the mode (2) indicates that the most common study time among students is 2 hours per day. This information can be valuable in understanding the study habits of the students.

      "Multiple Choice question: Many years ago, children who had good manners kept quiet if their parents were talking with other persons. Today, well-mannered children have more freedom.  Sometimes good manners in one place are bad manners in other place.  Suppose you are a visitor in the prefix = st1 /landofMongolia. Some friends ask you to eat with them. What kind of manners do they want you to have? They want you to give a loud \"burp\" after you finish eating. Burping will show that you like your food. In some countries, if you give a loud burp, you are told to say, \"Excuse me, please.\" In many places people like to eat together. But in some parts of Polynesia, it is bad manners to be seen eating at all. People show their good manners by turning their back on others while they eat.  What are good manners like in an East African town? The people try not to see you. They are being polite. You may see a friend. He may not see you at all. If you're polite, you will sit down beside him. You will wait until he finishes what he is doing. Then he will talk to you.  Suppose you visit a friend in Arabia. You should walk behind the tents until you come to his tent. If you pass in front of the other tents, you will be asked into them. The people will ask you to eat with them. And it is bad manners if you say no. Which of the following sentences is not true according to the passage?\n",
